fuckOff affords you a terminal interface to tell people to stop disturbing you when you're in the zone. After you're done setting it up, typing fuckOff speaks a random fuck you.

Needs foass and python3

     pip install foass

Fairly selfexplanatory code.

A good way to use this is to set up an alias for the python file execution.
Eg. 

    $ echo "alias fuckOff=python3 ~/PROJECTS/voiceInterface/foaas/fuckYou.py" >> ~/.bash_aliases && source ~/.bash_aliases
    
    $ fuckOff
    
    * computer tells everyone to fOff in a random way *
